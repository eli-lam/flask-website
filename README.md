# flask-website

Author: @eli-lam

This website was created for my web programming class. It started off as a personal website to show off my projects but changed into a personal website/blog where visitors can create an account and comment on my blog posts. I also created a subclass of users where I can give permission to another user to write a blog post. This would allow me to have guest writers.
