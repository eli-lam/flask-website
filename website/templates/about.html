        <h1>About Elizabeth Lam </h1>
        <p>Iâ€™m a computer science student at Concordia University. I'm currently the Command & Data Handling Lead for Space
        Concordia's Spacecraft Division. Hugely enthusiastic about space, design, and video games, I hope to one day contribute
            to the things I love. </p>
    <p>My current focus is on Computer Graphics and Flight Software development, both in C++.</p>
